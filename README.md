# HTML-emails-from-sight
Here i recreate an Html Email based on live items that come to my inbox. Some i recreate identically, some I adjust to my own taste.

One project is called " On the Square Virginia" 
Its based on an Constant Contact Email I received in July 2025. I would conside this a recreation project.

I downloaded the images, copied the plan text into  web broswer CONSOLE to remove all styling, and then I pasted the raw text data into VS Code.

So whatever stage this project is at, Im using just VSCode with W3Schools and MDN to recreate this project. 

When its done i will have two basic viewports. 
    -One for screens smaller than 650px, and 
    -One for screens larger then 650px wide.
